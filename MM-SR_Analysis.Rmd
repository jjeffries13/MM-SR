## Qualitative Data Analysis Method
### Journal Articles vs. IES Funded Proposals
Was there a significant difference in the frequency that a qualitative data analysis method was reported when comparing these two groups?
```{r}
prop.test(x = c(238, 39), n = c(256, 295), alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE) 
```

## Qualitative Data Analysis
### Journal Articles Level 1 vs. IES Funded Proposals Level 1
Was there a significant difference in the frequency that a qualitative data analysis method of complexity level 1 was reported when comparing these two groups?
```{r}
prop.test(x = c(58, 4), n = c(256, 295), alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE) 
```

## Qualitative Data Analysis
### Journal Articles Level 2 vs. IES Funded Proposals Level 2
Was there a significant difference in the frequency that a qualitative data analysis method of complexity level 2 was reported when comparing these two groups?
```{r}
prop.test(x = c(206, 28), n = c(256, 295), alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE) 
```

## Qualitative Data Analysis
### Journal Articles Level 3 vs. IES Funded Proposals Level 3
Was there a significant difference in the frequency that a qualitative data analysis method of complexity level 3 was reported when comparing these two groups?
```{r}
prop.test(x = c(20, 227), n = c(256, 295), alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE) 
```
