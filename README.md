#### Overview
|         The purpose of this repository is to be transparent in showing the statistical tests and results for our exploration of the research methods and designs used between IES and non-IES funded mixed methods educational research. The data used derived from qualitative coding of articles published by journals and proposals advertised by IES via their website between 2014-2019. To better understand the screening of the sample of articles used, check out the [PRISMA Chart](https://github.com/jjeffries13/MM-SR/blob/main/PRISMA%20Chart%20Appendix%20A.pdf) document. Coding of relevant articles focused on the methodology and study designs rather than specific outcomes. Using MaxQDA, articles and IES studies were analyzed by the two authors who independently coded half of the articles and the IES proposals. The [code list](https://github.com/jjeffries13/MM-SR/blob/main/IES%20Grant%20Research%20Code%20System.docx) utilized was divided into five components: research method, IES research purpose, quantitative method, qualitative method, and mixed methods integration type. The codes for the quantitative and qualitative methods were organized using Onwuegbuzie (2016) a priori coding scheme which places method complexity along continuums. Analyses regarded the differences betweeen IES and non-IES funded studies in terms of reporting of methods and codes across these continuums. 

#### Abstract
|         Educational research involving mixed methods (MM), or the integration of quantitative and qualitative methods, provides valuable contextual information that may be missing from traditional quantitative research within education. The Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development (Institute for Education Sciences; IES et al., 2013) does not contain any reference to the use of MM while MM is now encouraged by the IES, the U.S. Department of Education, and the National Science Foundation (IES et al., 2020). Most research funded by the IES tends to be quantitative. However, if either the quantitative or qualitative methods used within MM educational research lack rigor, then that research is not only less likely to receive funding by the IES, but also raises concerns regarding the quality of MM research within the field of education. While reviews have looked at the rigor of quantitative methods within MM research (e.g. Alise & Tedlie, 2010; Bash et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2015; Plano Clark et al., 2015), methodological rigor within particular fields of study within education (e.g. math education – Hart et al., 2009; Ross & Onwuegbuzie, 2014; school psychology – Powell et al., 2008), and federal funding of MM research within the health fields (Coyle et al., 2018; Guetterman et al., 2019; Plano Clark, 2010), there is an existing gap in literature regarding the integration of systematic reviews analyzing the methodological rigor of both MM research and federal funding within education. Additionally, integration of the systematic reviews should enable richer insight regarding the rigor of methods used.
